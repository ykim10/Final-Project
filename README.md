# Final-Project

Project Title ---> Sewege Pipe  or  Dance off

Summary
The project will utilize what I have learned in class to create a program to use some very simplistic animation I have made to make it a fun interactive tool to visually please the eye or to use to pass the time. I have had many different ideas some of which were too ambitious.

What I aim to do is improve upon older project and do something more to my tastes

The Sewege pipe will use the drip project and offer options on what to drip down with the ASDF keys

or

The Dance Off will use short gifs and add them into the musical instrument with new songs to go with them. with the ASDF keys you get to choose what style of dance you perform


There will be no building. It will all be coding and using gifs/animations/ or images drawn as reference

The most difficult part would be the animation and exactly what I intend to with the project, because it is still under thought process. The coding presents opportunities to puruse and explore.
