# Final-Project

Project Title ---> to be determined

Summary
The project will utilize what I have learned in class to create a program to use some very simplistic animation I have made to make it a fun interactive tool to visually please the eye or to use to pass the time.

There will be no building. It will all be coding and using gifs/animations as reference

The most difficult part would be the animation and exactly what I intend to with the project, because it is still under thought process.
